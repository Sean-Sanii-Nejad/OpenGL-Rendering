## Frustrum Manipulation
In this task, the camera perspective was changed by adjusting the `eye` vector, and the number of triangles was increased to 1000. Additionally, rendering of the triangles was removed to clearly expose the shape and boundaries of the frustum. These changes allow for a more accurate and detailed visualisation of the viewing volume, as seen in the three output canvases.

## Rotation Matrix 
Created a rotation matrix using `mat_motion`, where the object was rotated on the x-axis using an angle of `Math.PI/2` (90 degrees). This changed the view through continuous theta increments, resulting in different object orientations as visualised in the screenshots.

## Phong Shading
In this task, I implemented the Phong reflectance model by calculating the specular term using the surface normal, light direction, and reflection vector. This enhanced the lighting by adding realistic specular highlights, based on material properties and light positioning.

## Blinn - Phong Reflection
For this task, I modified the existing Phong shading algorithm by implementing the Blinn-Phong reflection model. This involved calculating a new halfway vector `h` using the sum of the light and view directions. The specular component was then computed using this vector, avoiding the need to calculate the reflection vector `r`. This approach changes how highlights appear and can be more efficient. The updated calculation is shown in the code snippet and reflected in the output render.

## Points vs Lines Primitives
In this task, I explored different primitive types by modifying the parameters of the `gl.drawElements` function. I replaced triangle rendering with `gl.POINTS` and adjusted `gl_PointSize` to visualize individual vertices on the mesh. For the second variation, I used `gl.LINES` instead, which connected vertices and emphasized the edges. This allowed for direct comparison between dot-based and edge-based representations of the mesh geometry.

## Fragment Z Coordinate Shading
In this task, I accessed the fragment's depth value using `gl_FragCoord.z` and applied a linear transformation to normalize it to a 0â€“1 range. I inverted the result to better highlight depth differences and passed this normalized value to all RGB channels in `gl_FragColor`, producing a grayscale depth visualization. The result appears smoother than previous outputs, likely due to using triangles instead of points or lines, which ensures more continuous interpolation between fragments.
